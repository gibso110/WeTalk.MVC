## Friend Requests

From this page you can view any friend request sent to you.

To accept the friend request click view request. Once you click view request you can add or block the user.

If you accept the request, the user will automatically be added to your friends list.

Additionally from the friend request page you can also delete a friend request.

In the top left-hand side of the page you can send a friend request in a similar manner that you can on the Friends page.



## Conversations

Here is the bread and butter of the app. From here you can view all of your conversations (one is automatically created when you add a new friend).

You will have the option to view (enter into) a conversation or delete the conversation.

Once you click view conversation, you will see all messages between you and the user you sent the message to.

The messages show whom they were sent by, what the message says (of course!), what time the message was sent, and if the message was updated, when the message was updated.

Finally, next to each message, you will be able to  edit or delete a sent message.
